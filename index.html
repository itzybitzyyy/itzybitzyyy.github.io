              <p>Because I could not stop for Death <br>
                He kindly stopped for me <br>
                The Carriage held but just Ourselves <br>
                And Immortality.<br><br>
                We slowly drove <br>
                He knew no haste <br>
                And I had put away<br>
                My labor and my leisure too,<br>
                For His Civility <br><br>
                We passed the School, <br>where Children strove
                At Recess – in the Ring <br>
                We passed the Fields of Gazing Grain <br>
                We passed the Setting Sun <br><br>
                Or rather – He passed Us <br>
                The Dews drew quivering and Chill <br>
                For only Gossamer, my Gown <br>
                My Tippet – only Tulle <br><br>
                We paused before a House that seemed<br>
                A Swelling of the Ground <br>
                The Roof was scarcely visible <br>
                The Cornice – in the Ground <br><br>
                Since then – 'tis Centuries – and yet<br>
                Feels shorter than the Day<br>
                I first surmised the Horses' Heads<br>

                Thou art more lovely and more temperate:<br>
                Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,<br>
                And summer’s lease hath all too short a date;<br>

                And every fair from fair sometime declines,<br>
                By chance or nature’s changing course untrimm'd;<br>
                But thy eternal summer shall not fade,<br>
                Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;<br>
                Nor shall death brag thou wander’st in his shade,<br>
                When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st:<br>
                So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,<br>
                 So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.</p>

              <p>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
                And sorry I could not travel both<br>
                And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
                And looked down one as far as I could<br>
                To where it bent in the undergrowth;<br><br>
                
                Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
                And having perhaps the better claim,<br>
                Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
                Though as for that the passing there<br>
                Had worn them really about the same,<br><br>
                
                And both that morning equally lay<br>
                In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>
                Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
                Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br>
                I doubted if I should ever come back.<br><br>
                
                I shall be telling this with a sigh<br>
                Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>
                Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—<br>
                I took the one less traveled by,<br>
                And that has made all the difference.<br></p>

              <p>Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness,<br>
                Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun;<br>
                Conspiring with him how to load and bless<br>
                With fruit the vines that round the thatch-eves run;<br>
                To bend with apples the moss'd cottage-trees,<br>
                And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core;<br>
                To swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells<br>
                With a sweet kernel; to set budding more,<br>
                And still more, later flowers for the bees,<br>
                Until they think warm days will never cease,<br>
                For summer has o'er-brimm'd their clammy cells.<br><br>
             
                Who hath not seen thee oft amid thy store?<br>
                Sometimes whoever seeks abroad may find<br>
                Thee sitting careless on a granary floor,<br>
                Thy hair soft-lifted by the winnowing wind;<br>
                Or on a half-reap'd furrow sound asleep,<br>
                Drows'd with the fume of poppies, while thy hook<br>
                Spares the next swath and all its twined flowers:<br>
                And sometimes like a gleaner thou dost keep<br>
                Steady thy laden head across a brook;<br>
                Or by a cyder-press, with patient look,<br>
                Thou watchest the last oozings hours by hours.<br><br>
             
                Where are the songs of spring? Ay, Where are they?<br>
                Think not of them, thou hast thy music too,—<br>
                While barred clouds bloom the soft-dying day,<br>
                And touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue;<br>
                Then in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn<br>
                Among the river sallows, borne aloft<br>
                Or sinking as the light wind lives or dies;<br>
                And full-grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn;<br>
                Hedge-crickets sing; and now with treble soft<br>
                The red-breast whistles from a garden-croft;<br>
                And gathering swallows twitter in the skies.<br></p>

                Grains of the golden sand —<br>
                How few! yet how they creep<br>
                Through my fingers to the deep,<br>
                While I weep — while I weep!<br>
                O God! Can I not grasp<br>
                Them with a tighter clasp?<br>
                O God! can I not save<br>
                One from the pitiless wave?<br>
                Is all that we see or seem<br>
                But a dream within a dream?<br></p>
